Pipeline Case Study
   Given three database tables containing information about deals and investors, generate two outputs:
   1) a list of deals with the investors (by name) who participated in that deal,
   2) an adjacency matrix where a connection between two investors (by virtue of having participated in the same deal) is denoted as one connection.
   Input: investor_general.dat, deal_investor_relation.dat, deals.dat
